    "Not very smart. Afraid of small, squeaky things, like mice. Has some rare temper issues - got angry at a copilot at 80 years old, killed the pilot in mid-flight. The airship crashed, and Lensool was the only survivor.  He went through some dark times after that. He then picked up with a group of revolutionaries, the Orzhov Radical Reformation Society, led by Kel, another Loxodon. They fell in love, and Kel was the only one who ever treated him with respect. They used to ambush arms shipments and assasinate members of the Orzhov upper eschelon that they blamed for the Orzhov taxation and trade/subjugation of souls and spirits. Karl was a third party mercenary that was sometimes hired for jobs. Then there was a plan that went wrong.  Kel was betrayed during an assassination attempt.  She was double crossed by a member of the Society.  Another society member had to kill her after she was captured, so that she wouldn't be tortured.  That was the last time that Lenstool saw Karl.\n"
